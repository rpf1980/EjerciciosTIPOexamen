A bad excuse is better than none
A bad penny always turns up
A bad tree does not yield good apples
A bad workman blames his tools
A barking dog seldom bites
A bird in hand is worth two in a bush
A black plum is as sweet as a white
A book holds a house of gold
A broken friendship may be soldered but it will never be sound
A burden of one's own choice is not felt
A burnt child dreads the fire
A calm sea does not make a skilled sailor
A cat has nine lives
A chain is no stronger than its weakest link
A change is as good as a rest
A closed mouth catches no flies
A constant guest is never welcome
A danger foreseen is half avoided
A day of sorrow is longer than a month of joy
A drop of ink may make a million think
A fault confessed is half redressed
A flower blooms more than once
A fly will not get into a closed mouth
A fool and his money are soon easily parted
A fool at forty is a fool forever
A friend in need is a friend indeed
A friend to all is a friend to none
A friend's eye is a good mirror
A good beginning makes a good end
A good conscience is a soft pillow
A good example is the best sermon
A good mind possesses a kingdom
A good name is better than a good face
A growing youth has a wolf in his belly
A guilty conscience needs no accuser
A handful of patience is worth more than a bushel of brains
A happy heart is better than a full purse
A heavy purse gives to a light heart
A hedge between keeps friendship green
A hungry belly has no ears
A hungry wolf is fixed to no place
An empty purse frightens away friends
An Englishman's home is his castle
Bad news travels fast
Be just before you are generous
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
Beauty is only skin deep
Beauty is the wisdom of womenWisdom is the beauty of men
Better an egg today than a hen tomorrow
Better be alone than in bad company
Better be the head of a dog than the tail of a lion
Better be untaught than ill-taught
Better flatter a fool than fight him
Better late than never
Better lose the saddle than the horse
Better safe than sorry
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't know
Better to drink the milk than to eat the cow
Beware of Greeks bearing gifts
Birds of a feather flock together
Blood is thicker than water
Blood will out
Charity begins at home
Children and fools tell the truth
Cleanliness is next to godliness
Clothes don't make the man
Constant occupation prevents temptation
Dead men tell no lies
Death is the great leveller
Diamonds cut diamonds
Diligence is the mother of good fortune
Discretion is the better part of valour
Diseases of the soul are more dangerousthan those of the body
Distance makes the heart grow fonder
Dogs of the same street bark alike
Don't bark if you can't bite
Don't count your chickens before they're hatched
Don't dig your grave with our own knife and fork
Don't judge a book by its cover
Easier said than done
Elbow grease is the best polish
Empty vessels make the most noise
Every ass likes to hear himself bray
Every cloud has a silver lining
Every man for himself
Every man has his price
Every man is the architect of his own fortune
Every path has its puddle
Every rose has its thorn
Every why has a wherefore
Everything in the garden is rosy
Experience is the father of wisdom
Facts speak louder than words
Failure teaches success
Fair exchange is no robbery
False friends are worse than open enemies
Familiarity breeds contempt
Fine words butter no parsnips
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
Friendship is love with understanding
Gardens are not made by sitting in the shade
Give someone an inch and they will take a mile or yard
Give someone enough rope and they will hang themselves
God helps those who help themselves
Good accounting makes good friends
Good and quickly seldom meet
Good management is better than good income
Great minds think alike
Great oaks grow from small acorns
Grief divided is made lighter
Half a loaf is better than none
Handsome is what handsome does
Hard words breaks no bones
Haste makes waste
Hatred is as blind as love
He can who believes he can
He has enough who is content
He laughs best who laughs last
He who hesitates is lost
He who is everywhere is nowhere
He who know nothing doubts nothing
He who pays the piper calls the tune
He who plays with fire gets burnt
He who wills the end wills the means
Health is better than wealth
Home is where the heart is
Honesty is the best policy
Honey catches more flies than vinegar
Hunger is a good sauce
The best advice is found on the pillow
The best helping hand is at the end of your sleeve
The best things in life are free
The darkest hour is just before dawn
The devil looks after his own
The devil makes work for idle hands
The die is cast
The early bird catches the worm
The end justifies the means
The first step is the hardest
